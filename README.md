# Crime-Analysis

Overview:
In this project, you will employ Tableau in crafting interactive dashboards to analyze crime data, facilitating law enforcement in comprehending crime patterns and trends. This endeavor will sharpen skills in data visualization, storytelling, and analytics, enabling effective communication of complex information. Moreover, it offers an opportunity to master crime data analysis techniques such as time series analysis and geographical mapping. This project not only addresses the immediate need for insightful crime analysis tools but also advances proficiency in data analytics within the realm of law enforcement.

Instructions:
• Review the learning materials in the Tableau course
• Carefully read the situation, tasks, actions, and result sections to grasp the assignment fully
• Complete and submit your assignment via the Learning Management System (LMS)
• Follow the provided guidelines closely, ensuring your report includes all required analyses and interpretations

Scenario:
Crime analysis is important for law-and-order maintenance at any place. It helps the police department and law enforcement agencies to identify patterns of crime, which is crucial for the effective planning of a crime prevention program. You are a data analyst in the research wing of the police department, and you are reached out to help the department analyze the data of past criminal activities. The purpose of crime data analysis is to support the operations of the police department, like criminal investigation, apprehension, prosecution, and development of crime prevention and reduction strategies.

Task:
As a data analyst, to keep the police department and the city updated on the statistics of crime events, you are tasked to create a dashboard or story using Tableau for the communication website and pay attention to data storytelling.

Action:
1. Overall Crime Statistics Dashboard:
   a. For personnel and resource management, the department needs to understand the count and types of crimes reported across        the city. Mark the locations on a geo-map highlighting the locations with recent criminal history.
   b. Identify the most common criminal incidents reported
   c. In this introductory dashboard, include a live crime feed to exhibit the total number of crimes reported to date for the       current year and the most recently reported crimes with their time and locations
2. Time Period Analysis Dashboard:
   Along with locations, the study of crime statistics across time statistics is also crucial for understanding the patterns      and planning those preventive strategies.
   a. Study distribution count of crime incidents across different time periods, such as day of the week or hour
   b. Further, explore the percentage of incident reporting for several time blocks (morning, afternoon, evening, and night)
3. Trend Analysis Dashboard:
   a. Create a dashboard to study the change in crime rate over different yearsb. Compare the change in the incident reporting       over the years for the same date and time
4. Comparative Analysis:
   a. Study the distribution of incidents reported where an arrest was made vs. not
   b. Identify what percentage of the reported incidents under each incident category are severe
   c. To make the dashboard interactive, provide filters for incident type and location in these dashboards for a granular           study
Result:
1. Overall Crime Statistics:
   Presents crime count and types across the city, with a geo-map marking recent incidents and a live feed of total crimes 
   reported
2. Time Period Analysis:
   Analyzes crime distribution by time, such as day of the week and hour, and explores reporting percentages for different 
   time blocks
3. Trend Analysis:
   Studies changes in crime rates over the years and compares incident reporting trends
4. Comparative Analysis:
   Examines the distribution of incidents where arrests were made versus those where no arrests were made. and identifies the     percentage of domestic incidents
5. Interactivity:
   Provides filters for incident type and location for detailed study
